Premium UI/UX Implementation Plan: StudyBuddy
Goal Description
Redesign StudyBuddy into a premium, $20/month tier EdTech SaaS product. The platform will pivot to a modern, focused, dark-mode-first aesthetic (Notion × Linear × Discord) optimizing for deep focus, collaboration, and high-quality micro-interactions.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

This is a massive structural and visual overhaul. Please review the design system and component inventory below. Once approved, I will implement this in phases: Phase 1 (Core Design System & Layout), Phase 2 (Dashboard & Sidebar), Phase 3 (Study Room & AI), Phase 4 (Flashcards & Library). Do you approve this design direction?

🎨 Design System
Color Palette (Dark-Mode First)
Primary Brand: Electric Indigo (#6C47FF)
Accent: Warm Amber (#F59E0B) or Teal (#14B8A6)

🧱 Component Inventory
Button: Variants: primary (indigo gradient), secondary (glassmorphism outline), ghost, danger. States: hover (lift & glow), loading (shimmer text).
Input: Variants: default (subtle border), focused (indigo ring + shadow), error (red ring).
Avatar: Sizes: sm/md/lg. Includes online status dots and absolute positioning for group avatar stacks.
Tag/Badge: Pill-shaped, semi-transparent background (bg-opacity-10), color-coded by subject.
Room Card: Glassmorphism effect, dynamic pulsing green border when active, avatar stack of members.
Stat Widget: Backdrop blur, large number, subtle trend arrow graph in the background.
Progress Ring: SVG circle for Pomodoro. Animated stroke-dashoffset using Framer Motion.
Modal: Deep backdrop blur (backdrop-blur-md), elevated dark surface, scale-up entrance animation.
Sidebar Nav Item: Icon + Label. Active state has a vertical indigo accent bar and subtle background gradient.
Notification Item: Unread dot, muted timestamp, hover state raises priority.
📄 Core Pages Design Specs
1. Dashboard (Home)
Layout: CSS Grid, 3 columns on large screens. Top greeting row, middle stats row, bottom timeline and active rooms.
Components: Stat Widgets, Heatmap, Progress Ring, Room Cards, AI Tip Card.
Colors: Surfaces use bg-card with an indigo radical gradient glow behind the active session ring.
Animation: Staggered fade-up on load (150ms delay per row).
Wow Factor: A GitHub-style "Study Streak" heatmap that subtly glows on days with extreme high activity.
2. Study Room (Live Space)
Layout: Split-pane. Left 70% is the interactive Editor/Board. Right 30% is the Participant/Chat panel.
Components: Avatar Stack, Rich Text Toolbar, Progress Ring (synced pomodoro), Reaction Bar.
Colors: Editor is pure bg-background for stark contrast. Toolbars are bg-elevated.
Animation: Avatars pulse when speaking. Emoji reactions float up and fade out.
Wow Factor: "Focus Mode" hotkey (Cmd+Shift+F) dims the entire UI except the glowing Pomodoro ring and the text editor.
3. Resource Library
Layout: Masonry grid layout with a sticky top filter bar.
Components: Resource Cards, Input (search), Tags (filters), Dropzone.
Colors: Cards are standard surface colors. The Dropzone uses an indigo dashed border.
Animation: Hovering a card lifts it -4px and increases the drop shadow.
Wow Factor: "AI Summarize" button on cards opens a sidebar streaming a GPT-generated summary of the PDF while showing a skeleton loader.
4. Flashcard Studio
Layout: Full-screen focus layout for studying. 2-column for deck creation.
Components: Flashcard (3D component), Progress Bar, Badges.
Colors: Dark surface cards with success/error semantic colors for "Remembered / Forgot" buttons.
Animation: True 3D CSS rotateY(180deg) flip animation.
Wow Factor: Spaced repetition badges that slowly shift from green to amber as the review date approaches.
5. Leaderboard & Gamification
Layout: Stacked list layout with top 3 users highlighted in podium format.
Components: Avatar, Progress bars, Badges (trophies).
Colors: Gold, Silver, Bronze accents for top 3. Indigo for the current user's highlight.
Animation: XP progress bars animate from 0 to current value on scroll.
Wow Factor: SVG Confetti burst physics animation triggered when leveling up a tier.
6. AI Study Assistant (Sidebar)
Layout: Fixed right-side panel, 400px wide. Scrollable chat area, sticky input at bottom.
Components: Chat bubbles, Code block renderers, Quick-prompt chips.
Colors: User bubbles are solid indigo, AI bubbles are bg-elevated.
Animation: Smooth slide-in from the right edge. Typing indicator dots bounce sequentially.
Wow Factor: Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting and mathematical LaTeX formula support.
Verification Plan
Because this task involves primarily visual and architectural overhaul, verification will center entirely on manual verification and visual QA logic:

CSS/Tailwind Validation: Run npx tsc && npx vite build to ensure all custom Tailwind colors and spacing scale compile successfully without throwing undeclared class errors.
Component Rendering: As Phase 1 completes, verify that the ThemeToggle and dark mode work seamlessly with the new core background/foreground colors.
Responsiveness: Resize window down to xs (475px) to ensure the 1280px max-width layout gracefully degrading into a single-column layout.
Visual Approval: The user must review Localhost across each Phase visually to confirm the Premium SaaS aesthetic is hit prior to continuing to the next phase.
